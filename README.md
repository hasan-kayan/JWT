# JWT Creater 
JSON Web Token creater project by C#. 
At this project I have created two different C# code to produce JWT. 
<br>
Two programs in the repository generate the signature of the JWT token with the HS512 algorithm by hashing with the SHA512 algorithm. 
<br>
Both programs use C# constructs with the same libraries. The main difference between them is that the token structure is customizable, while the program in the "JWT" folder produces output in the standard JWT architecture, the JWT Header parts in the output of the program in the "JWT HEADER OUT" folder have a customizable structure. 
<br>
The data to be moved can be managed in both. 
Mainly both of these programs created to use in UiPath Automations, you can wisit my other repository to see how to use it in UiPath.
